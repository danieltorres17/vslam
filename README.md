Stereo VO/SLAM simulation 

Stereo VO/VSLAM simulation I created because I wanted to build this from scratch. There's a lot to do still but it looks like the frame-to-frame motion estimator is working. 

### TODO: Frame-to-Frame Estimator

- [ ] Figure out why some iterations have infinite cost
- [ ] Add a proper abstraction class
